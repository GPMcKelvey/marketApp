<h1>Problem<h1/>
<p>Local sustainable food systems are vital to a healthy community, but the small farmer faces many struggles on the path to success. One of their biggest hurdles is the cost of labor to grow their business.<p/>
<h1>Solution<h1/>
We are a social network for local producers and potential volunteers. We facilitate and coordinate volunteers to help out on small farms & at market.
<h1>Market Size<h1/>
<p>According to the USDA 51% of farms have an average size of 81 acres or less. This is our key demographic. In Indiana alone that equates to almost 29,000 farms.<p/>
<h1>Competition<h1/>
<p>There are a few competitors that offer some similar features but none that facilitate volunteer opportunities for small agricultural operations like we do.<p/>
<h1>Business Model<h1/>
	<p>We are customer & mission driven with a freemium, subscription-based revenue stream.<p/>
<h1>Marketing and Sales<h1/>
<p>Initially marketing will be extremely heavy and focus on newspaper ads, booths are farmers markets, and social media. As the platform builds users we will rely less on traditional marketing and more on P2P referrals.<p/>
<h1>Progress to Date<h1/>
	<p>We currently have a complete frontend of the MVP.<p/>
<h1>Future Milestones<h1/>
	<p>Build backend and create a strong marketing push to generate users for our site.<p/>
